            <h1 class="home-h1">Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark</h1>
            <p class="home-p">Anthony ‚ÄúTony‚Äù Stark is the only son of the Howard Stark, a famous and influential
                industrialist and
                inventor. After his parents died, Tony, a genius in his own right, took over the family company, Stark
                Industries. Under his leadership, the company became one of the most profitable corporations in the
                world, but the main source of their income was their contracts to make weapons for the government. Tony
                became one of the richest and most respected scientists in the world, as well as being one of its most
                eligible bachelors.</p>

            <p class="home-p">When he made a visit to the war front itself, his life changed forever. He was captured by
                the enemy
                insurgents, and their attack left him critically injured. He only managed to survive thanks to the quick
                thinking of fellow prisoner, the captured scientist Professor Ho Yinsen, who developed a high-tech
                prosthesis to keep him alive. The warlord who captured Stark wanted him to build a powerful weapon. Tony
                agreed, but instead of building a weapon, he built a suit of iron armor to use against his captors. Once
                the suit was complete, Tony defeated and escaped the men who imprisoned him, but Yinsen died in the
                battle, sacrificing himself to give Tony enough time to finish preparing the armor.</p>

            <p class="home-p">When Tony made his way back to civilization, he resumed his role as head of Stark
                Industries, but decided
                to stop building weapons and instead focus on philanthropy. He also developed a new suit of armor and
                decided to use it to combat evil as Iron Man. As Iron Man, he became a founding member of The Avengers
                and has been a vital member since its inception. He originally used the lie that Iron Man was his
                bodyguard in order to protect his secret identity, but he eventually came out to the public as Iron Man.
